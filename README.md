# Coding_03
## Project Background
* Even before I entered CCI, I was impressed by the many ai-generated artworks. Especially after learning GAN. A lot of the best work I've seen has been made by GAN, so I want to learn more about how GAN works and make my work based on it
* Two-dimensional animation is my favorite art form, so I'm going to create an anime avatar generator

## Project Introduce
* I used my own version of the avatars dataset to train my model, which can be found in /data
* My model also includes discriminators and generators, and the main training strategy code was developed based on the examples in the forum and partially modified by myself
